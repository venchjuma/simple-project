      <strong>Trevanboy </strong>  is one of a kind talented artist.He is a very determined and pessimist upcoming artist who always see the bright side of every opportunity. 
        He always make much efforts in achieving his goals especially in expanding his musical talents.As you all know, success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in an day out.
        He always strive to bring his own sunshine no matter what the weather is. Believing in his talents and so many  reasons mentioned above and more others makes me proud to chose Trevanboy Africa as the Best Upcomingpcoming/Local Artist.
        Thanks.
